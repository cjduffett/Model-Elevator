# Model-Elevator

**A Dynamic Elevator Control System**

We designed and built a 4-floor model elevator that dynamically responds to user input through a series of on-structure and in-elevator call buttons. The system is driven by a single MSP430 cleverly optimized to handle the 14 inputs and 6 outputs that our system demands.
